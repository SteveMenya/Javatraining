        Documenting my trip around the US on my very own segway

        Well i made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting
        places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT,
        Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM

        I saw Burna Shave style design on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Passing cars, <br>
            When you can't see,<br>
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse,<br>
            Of eternity.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely wont be passing any cars. :)

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
        Because I'm on Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
        digital camera, and a protein bar.
        Just the essentials. As a Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
            with one step Segway.</q>
