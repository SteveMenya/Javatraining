        Well i made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting
        places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT,
        Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM

    <!-- Second Trip -->
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    I saw Burna Shave style design on the side of the road today; "Passing cars, When you
    can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
    I definitely wont be passing any cars. :)

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
        Because I'm on Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
        digital camera, and a protein bar.
        Just the essentials. As a Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one step Segway."
